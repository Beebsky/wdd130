            <p>Lagos City is the most populous city in Nigeria, with an estimated population of 21 million in 2015. 
               Lagos is the most populous urban area in Africa. 
               Lagos was the national capital of Nigeria until December 1991 following the government's decision to move their capital to Abuja in the centre of the country. 
               Lagos is a major African financial centre and is the economic hub of Lagos State and Nigeria at large. The city has a significant influence on commerce, entertainment, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, and fashion in Africa.</p>
