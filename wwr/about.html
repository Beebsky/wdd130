          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>Riverway Adventures was born from a love affair with adventure and a deep connection to the wild beauty of Kenya. Our story begins 2 years ago, when Ayansola Abeeb Gbolahan first felt the call of the river and set out to share its magic with the world.
            What started as a humble passion project quickly grew into something extraordinary. With a small team of dedicated guides and a handful of rafts, we began leading intrepid travelers on white-water expeditions unlike any other. 
            As word spread of our exhilarating trips and unparalleled expertise, Riverways Adventures blossomed into the premier adventure outfitter in the region.
            Over the years, we've weathered rapids, navigated challenges, and forged lasting bonds with countless adventurers from around the globe. 
            From families seeking a dose of excitement to corporate groups in search of team-building thrills, we've welcomed adventurers of all ages and backgrounds into the Riverways family.
            But our journey is far from over. As we look to the future, we remain committed to our founding principles of safety, sustainability, and unparalleled customer service. With each passing year, we strive to raise the bar higher, push the boundaries further, and continue sharing the wonders of the river with generations to come.
            Join us as we embark on the next chapter of our adventure. Whether you're a seasoned rafter or a first-time thrill-seeker, there's a place for you here at Riverways Adventures. Let's make waves together!
